description: Although Bram Stoker is best known for his world-famous novel Dracula,
  he also wrote many shorter works on the strange and the macabre. Comprised of spine-chilling
  tales published by Stoker's widow after his death, this collection demonstrates
  the full range of Stoker's horror writing. -Amazon.com.
